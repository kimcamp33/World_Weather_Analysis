# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to create a travel itinerary based on weather preferences.  The code searches 5,000 of the closest hotels with the minimum temperature of 69 degrees and the maximum temperature of 100 degrees.  Based on these parameters and the drivable, walking, or bikeable routes, four cities were found and an itinerary was created.
